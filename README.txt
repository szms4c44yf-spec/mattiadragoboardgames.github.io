# Theme Pack (Hero + Cards + Brand Accent)
Files to brighten your Minima Jekyll blog.

How to use
1) Upload these files into your repo (keep folders):
   - index.html
   - _includes/post-card.html
   - assets/main.scss
   - assets/custom.scss
   - assets/cover-fallback.svg
2) Commit on `main`. GitHub Pages will rebuild automatically.
3) (Optional) Open `_config.yml.additions.txt` and merge its content into your `_config.yml`
   to enable social icons and pagination.
4) To show an image on a card, add `image: /assets/your-image.jpg` in the post front matter.
